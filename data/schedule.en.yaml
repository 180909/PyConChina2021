            title: Behavior-driven Development in Python
            desc: |
              Behavior-driven Development (or Acceptance Test-driven Development) is a powerful Agile engineering practice
              that compliments other Agile and XP practices such as TDD, Continuous Delivery, etc.

              BDD Scenarios are high-level feature tests acting as "Specification by Example" written in a Gherkin DSL
              which is accessible to non-technical team members (like Product Managers, QA, etc).

              In this talk, we'll explore:
              - what BDD is
              - what are its technical and team benefits
              - what are the best Python tools for BDD (behave, pytest-bdd, cucumber)
              - how to use those tools and how to write BDD scenarios

              This will be a powerful new tool in your arsenal that you can bring back to your project and your team!

            title: A survey of current Python implementations
            desc: |
              Python has been ranked among the top 3 programming languages in the world for the past decade steadily,
              and is the most preferred language in the fields of Artificial Intelligence、Data Processing、Scientific
              Computing and DevOps etc. However, the performance of Python is still not satisfied due to many reasons.

              Fortunately, many emerging Python runtimes are coming in recent years and bringing new ideas to overcome the
              bottlenecks of Python runtime performance. This topic summarizes and compares various Python implementations
              that available today, and comes with the following sub-topics:

              1. C-based Python implementation
                a. make CPython faster;
                b. newly-arrived project Cinder;
              2. Java-based Python implementation, e.g. GraalPython and Jython;
              3. LLVM-based Python implementation, e.g. Pyston;
              4. DotNet-based Python implementation, e.g. IronPython and Pyjion;
              5. WASM-based Python implementation, e.g. Pyodide;
              6. Rust-based Python implementation, e.g. RustPython;
              7. Comparison of the above Python implementations and their benchmarkings.

            title: How to develop and maintain large Python server-side applications
            desc: |
              Many people think that Python is not suitable for developing large server-side applications because it is slow, error-prone,
              and difficult to maintain. Is this really the case? Or how do we deal with these issues?

              This talk will share why Python was chosen as the primary language for development of a large cloud service, how it was used
              for architecture design, development, testing, monitoring, team collaboration, and how to ensure fast and smooth implementation
              of business functions and maintainable code in architecture design, development, testing, monitoring, team collaboration,
              application release, and more.

            title: Exploration of AI backend architecture
            desc: |
              In the current period of rapid development of artificial intelligence, more and more companies are gradually joining this track, and more
              good AI products are emerging. However, as AI technology is maturing continuously, some problems are also exposed, such as how to better
              realize the landing of AI products?

              To achieve better implementation of AI products, having a good backend to interact with AI is very critical,
              and having a mature and stable AI backend architecture is a tiger's wing for companies that use a lot of AI technology.

            title: Sugarizing Python——MingShe
            desc: |
              This talk focuses on how to use Guido's PEG parser for Python 3.9 to create a Python superset,
              adding as much syntax as you want to bring Python to life.
              Next, I'll demonstrate a superset language I wrote using this technique, MingShe,
              which includes convenient syntax for pipes, partial functions, null merging, optional chaining, and more.
              And you can import MingShe's code directly as a Python module, without having to compile it in advance.
