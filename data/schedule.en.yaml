      desc: After Learning many computer languages, many people may have the idea
        of designing their own computer language. The key task is to design the language's
        grammar parser. Most current languages are parsed based on context-independent
        grammars. The expression parsing grammar PEG, a potential substitute for context-independent
        grammars, can also be implemented as a parser for computer languages and has
        many advantages that formal grammars do not have, such as ease of implementation,
        fast parsing, and no ambiguity. In addition, experts are experimenting with
        implementing Python parsers with PEGs. pyparsing is an easy-to-use PEG package
        for Python. The main goal of the presentation is to demonstrate how to design
        parsers with pyparsing. It will cover PEG principles and parser implementation
        techniques, the pyparsing design style, a demonstration of a computer language
        of your own design, and a series of interesting examples.

        development efficiency and maintainability through the use of the Python native
        Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) module in Jina Hub, which is designed to provide
        developers with the various Executors needed to build neural search systems
        using Jina. Not only can developers find the Executor they need at Jina Hub,
        but they can also publish custom Executors and share them with the entire
        community. By using the ast module to parse developers' code, we automate
        and standardize the generation and management of Dockerfiles and installation
        dependencies, allowing developers to focus more on the core functionality
        of the Executor. In addition, we use the ast module to help developers automatically
        generate Executor details to further facilitate sharing with the community.
        ast allows us to lower the development threshold and attract more developers
        to join the Jina Hub community by improving the maintainability of the code
        while ensuring the efficiency of community development.

      desc: 'DNA sequences have a wide range of applications in molecular biology
        and medical research, such as gene tracing, species identification, and disease
        diagnosis. If a large number of samples are taken in combination with the
        emerging genetic big data, the experimental results are usually more convincing
        and can be put into real-world applications more effectively. However, traditional
        nucleic acid sequence matching methods have many limitations and are not applicable
        to large scale data, which makes real world applications have to make a trade-off
        between cost and accuracy. To alleviate the constraints of nucleic acid sequence
        data characteristics, vectorization is a better choice for large amounts of
        DNA sequences. The implementation of DNA sequence vectorization can improve
        efficiency while helping to reduce the cost of research projects or system
        builds.


        Based on this idea, we tried to build a gene sequence classification system
        by combining NLP models and Milvus, an open source vector database. Tested
        with experimental data based on Milvus'' python SDK, we found that the system

      desc: 'As business innovation accelerates in the era of digital intelligence
        and automation, increasingly complex architectures and huge data volumes have
        placed higher demands on centralized big data platforms. On the other hand,
        how to quickly build applications, processes, and business solutions continue
        to accumulate, which has led to the explosion of Low-Code products in various
        fields in the past two years, and their related technologies are also applicable
        under the observability platform.

        This session introduces how to use low-code technologies (Python as an example)
        in building observability platforms to innovate the experience of using products
        and improve the flexibility of scenarios and engineering efficiency of solutions.
        The presentation will cover the key aspects of flexible data collection and
        processing, intelligent analysis, monitoring and alerting, and response automation,
        involving cloud-native, stream batch computing, OLAP, DSL, orchestration and
        templating technologies.

        Presentation outline. 1:

        1. background overview of observability and low-code technologies

        2. technical challenges, architecture design and technical difficulties in
        each aspect of the observability platform 3. best practices and use of Python
        technologies

        4. future expectations'
